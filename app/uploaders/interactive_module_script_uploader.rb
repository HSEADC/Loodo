  #   # ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_path("fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_'))

  # process scale: [200, 300]

  # version :thumb do
  #   process resize_to_fit: [50, 50]
  # end

  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_allowlist

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
